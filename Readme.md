## Project Overview
This project requires two separate Python environments to execute different tasks. Both environments need to be set up using Python 3.8, with different sets of dependencies for each.

### 1. Environment 1 - Required Libraries
The first environment is essential for data processing and model-related tasks. To set up this environment, you need to install the following libraries:

```
numpy==1.17.5
pandas==0.25.3
scikit-learn==0.22
scipy==1.7.1
synthpop==0.1.1
```

### 2. Environment 2 - Required Libraries
The second environment is specifically required for working with the `SDV` (Synthetic Data Vault) package. To set up this environment, you need to install the following library:

```
sdv==1.15.0
```

### Running the Project
To execute the project, you can use the provided batch file `run_script.bat`. Make sure the correct environment is activated before running the script.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure Python 3.8 is installed on your system before creating the environments.
- Use the appropriate virtual environment depending on the task you're running.

Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems during setup or execution.
